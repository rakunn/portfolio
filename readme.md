# Portfolio Site Project for Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program

## Technologies used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox ❤)
* Custom Fonts (Google Fonts & Font Awesome)


## Todos:
This project will be evolving. Especially, I plan to add additional sections such as **About**, **Contact Me** and extend Projects section to distinguish between **Websites / Web apps / Data visualization** projects. Much stuff to do, but I would like to base on what I have completed so far
